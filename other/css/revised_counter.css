            Revised: 22 September 2018 - Anchor elements removed.
            Mouse events improved.  Clickable area increased.

            An svg counter similar to that used by SL.  Because
            this is written as an svg it can easily be resized.

            Please contrast this counter with those previously
            posted here at:
            https://code.sololearn.com/Wn6r7eQ3kwli/#html and
            https://code.sololearn.com/WsX7DwcDjvdt/#html
