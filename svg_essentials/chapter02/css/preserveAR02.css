           This is a modified example taken from chapter 2 of 'SVG Essentials' by
           J. David Eisenberg.  In this example the aspect ration of the viewport
           and the viewBox differ and the attribute preserveAspectRatio "alignment
           slice" is used to determine how the image is rendered.
