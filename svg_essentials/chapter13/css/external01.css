                  An example of the use of the "object" tag to import an external
                  svg file into the html document.  In this case the svg file is
                  very similar to that used in the 'SGV script example 02' at
                  https://code.sololearn.com/WIN6AGUnXAQ0/#html.  The svg internal
                  script itself has been modified slightly for this example in
                  order to allow two way communication between the external file
                  and the web page.  See https://code.sololearn.com/W9RudqQZbQVI/#html
                  for details of the svg file.

                  This example is based on a similar example in chapter 13 of
                  'SVG Essentials' by J. David Eisenberg.
